# 🎬 Future Roadmap: Coming Attractions

Welcome to the **NC-FLIX Production Schedule**! Here's a sneak peek at what's hitting the screens soon and what's currently in the director's cut.

## 🍿 Now Showing (Released Features)

These features have cleared the cutting room floor and are live in the app:

*   **🎬 The Rewrite (MVVM Architecture)**: We've completely overhauled the script! The app now uses **MVVM** to keep the drama (logic) separate from the set (UI).
*   **🛡️ Stunt Doubles (Error Handling)**: No more crashes! We've replaced generic exceptions with a robust `Result` wrapper to handle stunts safely.
*   **🌍 Subtitles On (Localization)**: Hardcoded strings are a thing of the past. We've moved everything to `strings.xml` for a global release.
